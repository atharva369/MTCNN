# MTCNN

# The following Repo demonstrates how the MTCNN algorithm can be used to detect single/many faces and facial landmarks aswell

# Later we use the FaceNet model along with the cosine similarity to distinguish between 2 different photos.
# High cosine similarity indicates that the image vectors have small angle between them and thus belong to the same identity
